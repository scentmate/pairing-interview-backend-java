# Pairing interview exercise - Movies API

Hello there fellow dev!

First of all, thanks a lot for taking the time to pair with us, we appreciate it :)

For the day of our pairing interview, we'll have a 90 minutes pair programming session where we'll be building a very simple API. You'll be presented with the full details during our slot and we'll be walking through it together.

For now all you need to do is clone this repo and get familiar with it - it's a very very basic codebase, for sure you won't need to invest too much time ;)

See you then!
